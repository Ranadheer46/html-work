    <h1 align="left" id="about">Shivaji mode of war </h1>
    Shivaji maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji's army consisted of peasants of Maratha
    and Kunbi castes.[171] Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army. He realised that conventional warfare
    methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field
    artillery. As a result, Shivaji mastered guerilla tactics which became known as Ganimi Kawa in the Marathi
    language.[172][173] His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the
    most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local
    terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy.[174] Shivaji refused to
    confront the enemy in pitched battles. Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own
    choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them. Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used
    several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes,
    and psychological warfare.[175]

    Shivaji was contemptuously called a "Mountain Rat" by Aurangzeb and his generals, because of his guerilla tactics of
    attacking enemy forces and then retreating into his mountain forts

    Shivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha
    Empire. His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory.
    The Maval infantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and
    supported by Maratha cavalry. His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further
    inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare.

    Hill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy. Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers, describes the
    achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts.[180] Shivaji captured important Adilshahi
    forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in
    advantageous locations.[181] In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts,
    but it is likely the actual number "did not exceed 18."[182] The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji
    owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death.[183] Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a
    single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy. The officers acted jointly and provided mutual
    checks and balances.

    Aware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in
    1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein.[185] Marathi chronicles
    state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that
    the number never exceeded 160.[186]

    With the Marathas being accustomed to a land-based military, Shivaji widened his search for qualified crews for his
    ships, taking on lower-caste Hindus of the coast who were long familiar with naval operations (the famed "Malabar
    pirates"), as well as Muslim mercenaries.[186] Noting the power of the Portuguese navy, Shivaji hired a number of
    Portuguese sailors and Goan Christian converts, and made Rui Leitao Viegas commander of his fleet. Viegas was later
    to defect back to the Portuguese, taking 300 sailors with him.[187]

    Shivaji fortified his coastline by seizing coastal forts and refurbishing them. He built his first marine fort at
    Sindhudurg, which was to become the headquarters of the Maratha navy.[188] The navy itself was a coastal navy,
    focused on travel and combat in the littoral areas, and not intended for the high seas

    James Grant Duff, a British administrator, published his 3-volume work on History of Marathas in 1863.[196] This
    work is mostly a chronological sequence of events and more of a political history with little to no insight about
    other aspects of Maharashtra's history.[74]
    In the mid–19th century, Marathi social reformer Jyotirao Phule wrote his interpretation of the Shivaji legend,
    portraying him as a hero of the shudras and Dalits. Phule's 1869 ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great
    hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media.[197]

    In 1895, the Indian nationalist leader Lokmanya Tilak organised what was to be an annual festival to mark the
    birthday of Shivaji.[12] He portrayed Shivaji as the "opponent of the oppressor", with possible negative
    implications concerning the colonial government.[198] Tilak denied any suggestion that his festival was anti-Muslim
    or disloyal to the government, but simply a celebration of a hero.[199] These celebrations prompted a British
    commentator in 1906 to note: "Cannot the annals of the Hindu race point to a single hero whom even the tongue of
    slander will not dare call a chief of dacoits...?"[200]

    One of the first commentators to reappraise the critical British view of Shivaji was M. G. Ranade, whose Rise of the
    Maratha Power (1900) declared Shivaji's achievements as the beginning of modern nation-building. Ranade criticised
    earlier British portrayals of Shivaji's state as "a freebooting Power, which thrived by plunder and adventure, and
    succeeded only because it was the most cunning and adventurous ... This is a very common feeling with the readers,
    who derive their knowledge of these events solely from the works of English historians."[201]

    In 1919, Sarkar published the seminal Shivaji and His Times, hailed as the most authoritative biography of the king
    since James Grant Duff's 1826 A History of the Mahrattas. Sarkar was able to read primary sources in Persian,
    Marathi, and Arabic, but was challenged for his criticism of the "chauvinism" of Marathi historians' views of
    Shivaji.[202] Likewise, although supporters cheered his depiction of the killing of Afzal Khan as justified, they
    decried Sarkar's terming as "murder" the killing of the Hindu raja Chandrao More and his clan.[203]

    In 1937, Dennis Kincaid, a British civil servant in India, published The Grand Rebel.[204] This book portrays
    Shivaji as a heroic rebel and a master strategist fighting a much larger Mughal army.
